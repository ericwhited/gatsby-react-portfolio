The Tye Dyed Iguana was a client was looking to invest in a custom redesign of their website on the BigCommerce platform. They were looking for a way to address part of the companyâ€™s overall strategy, including: improving site performance and user experience, especially the mobile experience; improving conversions; and increasing sales. 

My role in this project was unique this time around. I was to provide high-fidelity designs for both the client AND develop the site as well. This meant working closely with the client throughout the design and revision process to create something that they loved. 

Once the design phase was completed I moved on to the development of the site. Alongside my team we developed the site and put it through its revision and QA process for the clients approval. Getting to handle both the design and development aspects of this project has easily made it one of my favorites to work on.
