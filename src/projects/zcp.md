The ZCP clothing design is an activewear clothing concept meant for an e-commerce platform. The inspiration for this concept came from the desire to use high quality photography assets and to break the mold from the same storefront designs I was used to. This project definitely gave me the opportunity to do so with the use of dark colors throughout with splashes of high contrast on key elements.
